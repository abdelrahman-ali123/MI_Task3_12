## Features
- Monitoring vital signals in real-time
- block diagrams that shows system components and means of communication.
- Ploting signal on 𝑋̅-chart. This chart is responsible for monitoring measurements mean and determine whether a sample is in-control or out-of-control and fire the proper alarm after detecting any out-of-control signal.
